# 🛡️ Endpoint Detection Lab with Splunk & Sysmon

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates detecting malicious endpoint activity with **Sysmon** and **Splunk** in a VMware lab.  
A reverse shell attack was simulated from Kali Linux against a Windows 10 VM. Sysmon telemetry was ingested into Splunk and analyzed to trace the attack.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Configure Sysmon on Windows 10 for endpoint telemetry
- Ingest logs into Splunk Enterprise
- Simulate a reverse shell attack from Kali Linux
- Detect suspicious processes and network connections in Splunk
