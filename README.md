# üõ°Ô∏è Endpoint Detection Lab with Splunk & Sysmon

## Objective
The Endpoint Detection Lab project was designed to create a controlled environment for simulating and detecting malicious activity on a **Windows 10** endpoint. The primary focus was to collect telemetry with **Sysmon**, ingest and analyze logs within **Splunk Enterprise**, and generate test data through adversary emulation using **Metasploit**. This hands-on exercise provided practical experience in identifying reverse shell activity, investigating suspicious processes, and correlating events to reconstruct an attack timeline, strengthening core SOC analyst detection and investigation skills.

- Configure **Sysmon** on Windows 10 for endpoint telemetry
- Ingest logs into **Splunk Enterprise**
- Simulate a **reverse shell attack** from Kali Linux with Metasploit
- Detect suspicious network connections and child processes in Splunk
- Investigate the attack timeline using Sysmon + Splunk correlation

## üîç Detection in Splunk (Blue Team)

### 1. Initial Baseline Search

To begin detection, I confirmed that Sysmon telemetry was ingested into Splunk by running a broad `index=endpoint search`. This baseline query verified that log collection was working, with 422 events available for further investigation.

![splunk index=endpoint](screenshots/2025-09-11-050056.png)

*Ref 4: Screenshot showing the initial Splunk query (index=endpoint) confirming that Sysmon logs were successfully ingested, with 422 events available for investigation.*

---

### 2. Broad Network Search (EventCode=3) 

With ingestion confirmed, I pivoted to network activity. Sysmon EventCode 3 logs process-initiated connections, and a search revealed 125 events from the endpoint during the observed period.

```spl
index=endpoint EventCode=3
```

![splunk Event Code 3](screenshots/2025-09-11-050526.png)

*Ref 5: Screenshot showing a Splunk query for Sysmon EventCode 3 (Network Connections). This broad search returned 125 events and served as the foundation for identifying the reverse shell connection on TCP port 4444.*

---

### 3. Rare Port Discovery

After identifying overall network connections, I analyze the dest_port field. Most activity involved expected system ports (5353, 5355, 443), but a single connection appeared on TCP port 4444. This stood out as anomalous since it is commonly used for reverse shells, confirming suspicious outbound activity from the endpoint.

![splunk Event Code 3 Results](screenshots/2025-09-11-050745.png)

*Ref 6: Screenshot of Splunk field analysis for dest_port. Most traffic used expected system ports (5353, 5355, 443), but a rare connection on port 4444 was identified ‚Äî the reverse shell session created by the malicious payload.*

---

### 4. Suspicious Network Connection (Discovery)

After spotting the anomalous port, I refined the search further to filter on both the attacker‚Äôs IP address (192.168.117.130) and destination port 4444. This revealed a single outbound connection from the victim, confirming the communication channel used by the malicious payload to establish the reverse shell.

```spl
index=endpoint EventCode=3 dest_ip=192.168.117.130 dest_port=4444 
```

![splunk Dest Port and Source IP](screenshots/2025-09-11-053336.png)

*Ref 7: Screenshot showing Splunk query results confirming outbound traffic from the victim to the attacker‚Äôs IP (192.168.117.130) on TCP port 4444. This connection corresponds to the reverse shell established by the malicious payload.*

---

### 5. Pivot to Process Creation (EventCode=1)

After spotting the network connection, I pivoted to Sysmon `EventCode 1` (process creation) to find which process initiated the traffic.

![splunk Dest Port and Source IP](screenshots/2025-09-11-053730.png)

*Ref 8: Screenshot showing Splunk field analysis of Sysmon EventCodes. By pivoting from EventCode 3 (network connections) to EventCode 1 (process creation), analysts can identify the binary (Resume.pdf.exe) responsible for initiating the reverse shell.*

---

### 6. Malicious Binary Execution (Resume.pdf.exe)

The process analysis reveald that a suspicious binary named `Resume.pdf.exe` had executed from the Downloads folder. This executable matched the Metasploit payload previously delivered to the system. Its execution serves as the root cause of the anomalous network activity and marks the initial compromise stage of the attack. 

![splunk process exec Resume.pdf.exe](screenshots/2025-09-11-051136.png)

*Ref 9: Screenshot showing Splunk query results for Sysmon EventCode 1. The malicious process Resume.pdf.exe was identified as the binary responsible for initiating the reverse shell connection.*

---

### 7. Suspicious Child Processes (Process Tree Investigation)

To understand the full behavior of the binary, I investigated its child processes. The Sysmon logs showed that Resume.pdf.exe spawned cmd.exe, a clear indicator of suspicious activity since PDFs do not normally generate command shells. This parent-child relationship provides critical context in confirming malicious behavior.

```spl
index=endpoint Resume.pdf.exe EventCode=1
```

![Suspicious Process Tree1](screenshots/2025-09-11-054719.png)

*Ref 10: Screenshot showing Splunk process tree analysis. The malicious binary Resume.pdf.exe spawned cmd.exe, confirming suspicious child process activity leading to the reverse shell (Expand the data to gain more information).*

---

### 8. Parent/Child Process Correlation (Detailed View)

To validate the attack chain, I examined parent/child process relationships. Sysmon logs showed that the malicious binary `Resume.pdf.exe` launched `cmd.exe`. This correlation confirms how the attacker gained execution, as malicious binaries typically spawn command shells to run follow-on commands or invoke additional payloads.

![Suspicious Process Tree2](screenshots/2025-09-11-055024.png)

*Ref 11: Screenshot below shows Sysmon event fields linking Resume.pdf.exe (parent) to cmd.exe (child), with process IDs, GUIDs, and hashes captured as indicators of compromise (IOCs).*

---

### 9. Timeline of Attack (Correlating Activity by GUID)

Building on the parent/child process correlation from the previous step, I pivoted on the Process GUID linked to Resume.pdf.exe. Using this identifier, I reconstructed the attack timeline in Splunk. The results showed `Resume.pdf.exe` spawning `cmd.exe`, which then executed reconnaissance commands (`ipconfig`, `whoami`, `net localgroup`, `net user`). This confirmed that the reverse shell was not only established but also actively used for system exploration.

```spl
index=endpoint {8519ae3f-07b6-68c0-ea0a-000000001500}
| table _time,ParentImage,Image,CommandLine
```
